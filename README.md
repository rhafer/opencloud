# Server Backend


> [!TIP]
> For general information about OpenCloud and how to install please visit [OpenCloud on Github](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/) and [OpenCloud GmbH](https://opencloud.eu).

This the main repository of the OpenCloud server. It contains the golang codebase for the backend services.

## Getting Involved

The OpenCloud server is released under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE). The project is very happy to receive contributions in all forms. Start hacking now 😃

### Build OpenCloud

To build the backend, follow these instructions:

Generate the assets needed by e.g. the web UI and the builtin IDP

``` console
make generate
```

The compile the `opencloud` binary

``` console
make -C opencloud build
```
That will produce the binary `opencloud/bin/opencloud`. It can be started as a local test instance right away with a two step command:

```bash
opencloud/bin/opencloud init && opencloud/bin/opencloud server
```
This creates a server configuration (by default in `$HOME/.opencloud`) and starts the server.

For more setup- and installation options consult the [Development Documentation](https://docs.opencloud.eu/opencloud/).

### Contribute

We very much appreciate contributions from the community. Please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to get started.

## Technology

Important information for contributors about the technology in use.

### Authentication

The OpenCloud backend authenticates users via [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) using either an external IdP like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or the embedded [LibreGraph Connect](https://github.com/libregraph/lico) identity provider.

### Database

The OpenCloud backend does not use a database. It stores all data in the filesystem. By default, the root directory of the backend is `$HOME/.opencloud/`.

## Security

If you find a security related issue, please contact [security@opencloud.eu](mailto:security@opencloud.eu) immediately.
